**Goal:** Analyze the setup and execution of the test method named **$arg** to generate both SQL data setup and any relevant API requests as runnable curl commands.

**Instructions for the AI:**

1.  **Locate Context:** Find the definition and all relevant setup code for the test method `$arg`.
2.  **Generate SQL Setup:**
    * Analyze all **data object creation** (e.g., ORM initialization, repository saves) in the setup phase.
    * Generate a single, executable **SQL script** to replicate this data.
    * **Format:** Use `INSERT` statements with explicit columns. Include `DELETE FROM` statements for affected tables before the `INSERT`s.
3.  **Generate cURL Commands:**
    * Analyze the **execution phase** of `$arg` for any direct or indirect API/HTTP requests
    * For each request found, generate a corresponding **`curl` command**.
    * **Include:** Method (`-X POST`), URL, Headers (especially `Authorization` or `Content-Type`), and the Request Body (`-d`).
    * **Crucial Context for Identity Header:** When the test setup includes an identity or user context, ensure the correct `x-rh-identity` header is included in the cURL command. The value for this header is a Base64-encoded JSON payload, which can take one of the following example formats:

    **Example Identity Header Payloads:**

    ```json
    {
      "identity": {
        "type": "Associate",
        "associate" : {
          "email": "test@example.com"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    ```json
    {
      "identity": {
        "type": "X509",
        "x509" : {
          "subject_dn": "CN=test.example.com"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    ```json
    {
      "identity": {
        "type": "User",
        "org_id": "org123"
      }
    }
    ```

4.  **Output Structure:**
    * **Section 1: Initial Environment Setup** (The preparatory steps below).
    * **Section 2: SQL Data Setup** (The generated SQL script).
    * **Section 3: API Command Execution** (The list of generated `curl` commands).

**Example cURL Analysis (for context, do not include in final output):**
If the test calls `POST /api/rhsm-subscriptions/v1/instances/billing_account_ids` with a JSON body, the output should include:
```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8000/api/rhsm-subscriptions/v1/instances/billing_account_ids?org_id=org1&product_tag=rhel-for-arm&billing_provider=aws' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-rh-identity: eyJpZGVudGl0eSI6eyJvcmdfaWQiOiJvcmcxIiwidHlwZSI6IkFzc29jaWF0ZSIsImF1dGhfdHlwZSI6ImJhc2ljLWF1dGgiLCJpbnRlcm5hbCI6eyJhdXRoX3RpbWUiOjAsIm9yZ19pZCI6Im9yZzEifX19'
```

## **Output**

### **Section 1: Initial Environment Setup**

These steps are required to start the local environment before executing the data setup or API commands. Replace `swatch-tally` with the correct project name (e.g., `swatch-contracts`, `swatch-metrics`).

1.  **Start Pods**
    ```bash
    podman-compose up -d
    ```

2.  **Update Database**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw -f swatch-database/pom.xml exec:java
    ```

3.  **Start Service**
    ```bash
    make swatch-tally
    ```
