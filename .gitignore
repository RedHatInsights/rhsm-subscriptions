# Spring Boot reads local configuration out of a directory named config.
# However, Gradle also looks for project configurations - most notably
# Checkstyle configuration - in the config directory.  This section hides
# everything directly under the config directory except what Gradle is
# going to use or files used for developer deployment (certificates and key)

# The logic here is complicated.  We want to ignore all bin directories because
# build artifacts land there.  Except we want to track the bin directory at the
# top level (where we keep our scripts).  But in that top level bin directory
# we don't want to track the main or test directory since those also have build
# artifacts.
