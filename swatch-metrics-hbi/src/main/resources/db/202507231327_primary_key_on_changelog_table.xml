  These changeSets are only for PostgreSQL because the primary keys we're adding are just to satisfy
  PostgreSQL's requirements for logical replication.  See
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/logical-replication-publication.html

  Consequently, these keys aren't mapped in JPA so we don't need to worry about them during
  in-memory DB tests.

    Creating an extension requires superuser permissions.  But in some environments, we don't
    have those permissions.  We have to create the extension in an out-of-band migration.

    The creation command checks permissions before it checks the extensions existence, so even an
    invocation that would have no effect will cause the changeset to fail.  Accordingly, we have to
    have a pre-condition to check if we should even attempt to create the extension.  That way we
    can use the same changeset everywhere.

    I am intentionally not providing a rollback because we have multiple change logs.  Rolling back
    the extension in one changelog could adversely affect the operations of the other changelog.
