      Clean up any rolled up DAILY remittance data as it is no longer needed,
      remove the granularity column and update the primary key. If the remittance
      sync has already been done, only DAILY remittance will need to be deleted as
      there will be no MONTHLY remaining after the sync. If it hasn't been run,
      all remittance will be initially tagged with MONTHLY and will be considered
      the existing remittance that has been applied.
