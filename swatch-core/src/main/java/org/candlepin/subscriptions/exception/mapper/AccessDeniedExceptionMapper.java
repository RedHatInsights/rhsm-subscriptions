/**
 * This handler catches AccessDeniedExceptions that are thrown when access is denied by the
 * annotation-based security system. When AccessDeniedExceptions are thrown due to violations of the
 * declarative security constraints defined in the JavaConfig (e.g. using <code>hasRole()</code>),
 * the exception is handled by the AccessDeniedHandler defined on the ExceptionTranslationFilter.
 * Annotation based restrictions use a different pathway. Theoretically, the exception could be
 * handled by adding an ExceptionHandler annotation to the {@link
 * org.springframework.security.web.access.AccessDeniedHandler#handle(HttpServletRequest,
 * HttpServletResponse, AccessDeniedException)} method, but since we aren't doing that anywhere else
 * that would add an additional exception handling path for just one circumstance. Instead, the
 * easiest thing to do is to let the AccessDeniedException get thrown, leave Spring, and get handled
 * by JAX-RS like the rest of our exceptions. It is important to remember, however, that
 * AccessDeniedExceptions can still occur during the regular authentication/authorization process
 * and those will still be handled by our implementation of the AccessDeniedHandler interface,
 * {@link org.candlepin.subscriptions.security.RestAccessDeniedHandler}
