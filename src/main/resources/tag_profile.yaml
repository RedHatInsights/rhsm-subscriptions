# Tags describe the categories that a particular offering should be placed in.  For example, a
# customer who has a system with engineering product ID 68 (RHEL Desktop) should have that system
# categorized as "RHEL" and as "RHEL Desktop".  Multiple attributes can affect which tag is applied.

# The tagMappings section defines how tags relate to system attributes.  Each tagMapping has a
# value, a value type, and the tags it is associate with.  For example, a system with architecture
# "arm64" would get the "RHEL for ARM" tag.  The value is "arm64", the value type is "architecture",
# and the tag is "RHEL for ARM".

# Individual tags can be measured in different ways.  The tagMetrics section defines these
# measurements.  A tag will, at minimum, have a "uom" attribute (unit of measure) that defines the
# units being tracked (e.g. cores).  Tags that rely on pulling information from Prometheus will have
# additional information that defines the Prometheus metric being used, the metric ID, etc.

# The tagMetaData section defines additional information around how a tag is tallied.  Most notably,
# tags need to have their finest granularity defined so that we can create accurate snapshots.  A
# tag that only supports DAILY granularity shouldn't be tallied hourly, for example.  Other metadata
# can also be applied here in a key-value fashion.
