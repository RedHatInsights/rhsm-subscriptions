/**
 * A simple class to check that the user has opted in. This class can be used from a SpEL expression
 * like so "@optInChecker.checkAccess(authentication)".
 *
 * <p>Normally, this type of check would be handled via a role, ROLE_OPTED_IN, and Spring Security
 * would check for the required role on the relevant endpoints. However, we want to return a custom
 * error message telling the user they need to opt in. If the user is missing a role, Spring
 * Security just returns a generic "Access Denied" message. So instead of using a role, we have this
 * custom class in the authorization layer to control the error message returned.
