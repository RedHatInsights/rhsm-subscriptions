/**
 * Responsible for resolving conflicting {@link org.candlepin.subscriptions.db.model.EventRecord}s
 * for incoming {@link org.candlepin.subscriptions.json.Event} messages and resolving them. A
 * conflict occurs when an incoming event shares the same lookup hash as existing event records in
 * the DB. Since event records can share the same timestamp, all existing records will be included
 * during resolution.
 *
 * <pre>
 * Example Conflict/Resolutions:
 *
 * No Conflicts
 *  - Incoming event is valid and no resolution required.
 * Conflicting event with equal measurements
 *  - Incoming Event is ignored.
 * Conflicting event with different measurements
 *  - EventRecord added with a negative accumulative measurement value
 *  - e.g. An incoming event has a measurement of 10 cores. An existing EventRecord matching
 *         the lookup hash has a measurement of 20 cores. An EventRecord would be created with
 *         a cores value of -10 and another EventRecord created to apply the new value of 20
 *         cores.
